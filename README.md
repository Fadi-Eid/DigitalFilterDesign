## Current Version: V2.0

# Introduction:
**DigitalFilterDesigner 2024** is an open-source project dedicated to simplifying the process of digital linear phase (FIR) filter design. The aim is to facilitate the creation of customizable multiband digital filters with ease of design and implementation.

The current version offers Python code for the automatic design of FIR low-pass filters using two methods: the __**windowed-sinc method**__ and the __**Kaiser adjustable**__ window method and a python API to automatically generate arbitrary gain, multiband FIR filter using the __**weighted least-squares**__ method. The algorithms are written in Python, allowing users to generate filter coefficients by adjusting parameters. After filter generation, the user can utilize the built-in plotting methods to validate the filter magnitude response.

The Least-Squares method, which is the most versatile and general method, is available in GUI form.

# Repository Structure:
### The repository consists of three main folders:

1. **FIR**: Contains algorithms and methods for linear phase finite impulse response filter design.
2. **App**: Desktop app presenting a user-friendly, code-less interface for FIR design (Least-Squares method).
3. **Media**: Software logo and media-specific files

> Each folder includes a README providing detailed documentation and guidance.
