# About
This initiative aims to facilitate the creation process of multiband, linear phase FIR filters. Designing filters can be a complex task, involving numerous steps such as defining the desired amplitude response, selecting filter length/order, and fine-tuning transition bands. Engineers often find themselves iterating through these steps multiple times until achieving satisfactory results.

_Digital Filter Designer 2024_ user interface simplifies this process by providing engineers with intuitive controls to make adjustments, visualize responses, and compute crucial metrics like group delay and mean-squared-error in transition regions. Users can easily add or remove bands as needed. Additionally, the interface offers the convenience of generating MATLAB code for further analysis and study.


# Building from source
The software was tested using **_Python 3.10.6_** but should also work for any python version above 3.10.
Clone this repository on you machine, intsall the required modules listed in _requirements.txt_ file and run the program using the command _**python main.py**_ on Windows and _**python3 main.py**_ on Linux.
For a standalone installation (Might be a little bit slow to load), see below.
